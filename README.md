# Demos for Unlock insights with AWS GenAI services (re:Invent BOA303)

This repository is complementary to breakout session on "BOA303 - Unlock insights with AWS GenAI services" at [re:Invent 2023](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)

In these demos, you will explore how RAG ( Retrieval-Augmented Generation ) can enhance AI models by leveraging external data sources to provide context-aware answers and unlock insights.

Learn 2 ways to use your data with GenAI models:

1Ô∏è‚É£ DEMO1: Deploying Llama2 with Sagemaker, CodeWhisperer + Kendra for data retrieval 

2Ô∏è‚É£ DEMO 2: Using Claude 2 with Bedrock + Vector DB for data retrieval
